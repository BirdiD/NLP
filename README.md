# NLP : Logistic Regression Sentiment Analysis
You'll find in this repository a jupyter notebook in which I implemented logistic regression for sentiment analysis. Sentiment Analysis is the process of interpreting and classifying polarity within a text data. It uses Natural Language Processing & text analysis techniques to determine whether a text expresses a positive, negative or a neutral emotion.

# The Dataset

I used Twitter dataset to do sentiment analysis. The dataset is composed of more than 14000 tweets. Given tweets about six US airlines, the task is to predict whether a tweet contains positive, negative, or neutral sentiment about the airline. The dataset can be downloaded here (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kolaveridi/kaggle-Twitter-US-Airline-Sentiment-/master/Tweets.csv).
